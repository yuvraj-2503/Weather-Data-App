# Weather Data App
This is a very basic project in android which shows weather details of user's current location.
I have used Kotlin to build this project. The app uses gps of user's phone to get user's location and extracts data 
for the current location from **Open Weather Map API**.

After cloning this repo, make sure to change the kotlin class **Config.kt** in the following directory :
[./Weather-Data-App/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com.example.weatherdataapp](./Weather-Data-App/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/weatherdataapp/Config.kt)
and inside the class, create a variable named API_KEY and store your api key as a string.
(Get your API KEY from Open Weather Map Website)
